            The Vipassana Meditation, can be translated as “Insight,” a clear awareness of exactly what is happening as
            it
            happens. Samatha can be
            translated as “concentration” or “tranquility.” It is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused
            only
            on one
            item and not allowed to wander. When this is done, a deep calm pervades body and mind, a state of
            tranquility
            which must
            be experienced to be understood.

        <h2>The oldest buddhist meditation practice</h2>
        <p>
            Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. Vipassana is a direct and gradual cultivation of
            mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by piece over a period of
            years. The student’s attention is carefully directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his own
            existence.
            The meditator is trained to notice more and more of his own flowing life experience.
            Vipassana is a gentle technique. But it also is very, very thorough. It is an ancient and codified system of
            training
            your mind, a set of exercises dedicated to becoming more and more aware of your own life experience. It is
            attentive
            listening, mindful seeing and careful testing.

        <h2>Discover yourself</h2>
        <p>
            Through the process of mindfulness, we slowly become aware of what we really are down below the ego image.
            We wake up to what life really is. It is not just a parade of ups and downs, lollipops and smacks on the
            wrist. That is an illusion. Life has a much deeper texture than that if we bother to look, and if we look in
            the right way.

            Vipassana is a form of mental training that will teach you to experience the world in an entirely new way.
            You will learn for the first time what is truly happening to you, around you and within you. It is a process
            of self-discovery, a participatory investigation in which you observe your own experiences while
            participating in them as they occur.

        <h2>Why focusing is so important ?</h2>
        <p>
            The first question we might have is why use any focus of attention at all? We are, after all, trying to
            develop awareness. Why not just sit down and be aware of whatever happens to be present in the mind? In
            fact, there are meditations of that nature. They are sometimes referred to as unstructured meditation and
            they are quite difficult.

            The mind is tricky. Thought is an inherently complicated procedure. By that we mean that we become trapped,
            wrapped up, and stuck in the thought chain. One thought leads to another which leads to another, and
            another, and another, and so on. Fifteen minutes later we suddenly wake up and realize we spent that whole
            time stuck in a daydream or sexual fantasy or a set of worries about our bills or whatever. <br>

        <h2>Breathing</h2>
        <p>
            Breathing satisfies all these criteria and more. It is common to every human being. We all carry it with us
            wherever we go. It is always there, constantly available, never ceasing from birth till death, and it costs
            nothing.

            Breathing is a non-conceptual process, a thing that can be experienced directly without a need for thought.
            Furthermore, it is a very living process, an aspect of life that is in constant change. The breath moves in
            cycles-inhalation, exhalation, breathing in, and breathing out. Thus, it is a miniature model of life
            itself.

            Breath is a phenomenon common to all living things. A true experiential understanding of the process moves
            you closer to other living beings. It shows you your inherent connectedness with all of life. Finally,
            breathing is a present-time process.

        <h1>What Is Vipassana Meditation ?</h1>
        <img src="" alt="">
        <p>
            The Vipassana Meditation, can be translated as “Insight,” a clear awareness of exactly what is happening as
            it
            happens. Samatha can be
            translated as “concentration” or “tranquility.” It is a state in which the mind is brought to rest, focused
            only
            on one
            item and not allowed to wander. When this is done, a deep calm pervades body and mind, a state of
            tranquility
            which must
            be experienced to be understood.

        <h2>The oldest buddhist meditation practice</h2>
        <p>
            Vipassana is the oldest of Buddhist meditation practices. Vipassana is a direct and gradual cultivation of
            mindfulness or awareness. It proceeds piece by piece over a period of
            years. The student’s attention is carefully directed to an intense examination of certain aspects of his own
            existence.
            The meditator is trained to notice more and more of his own flowing life experience.
            Vipassana is a gentle technique. But it also is very, very thorough. It is an ancient and codified system of
            training
            your mind, a set of exercises dedicated to becoming more and more aware of your own life experience. It is
            attentive
            listening, mindful seeing and careful testing.
